## PR-002: MixMatch: A Holistic Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning

- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02249)
- [Code](https://github.com/google- research/mixmatch)
- _Berthelot et al., NIPS 2019_
- Keywords: **semi-supervised learning**
- Summary:
- - leverage unlabeld samples; need smaller num of labels
- - learn data representations (manifold) from unlabeld data
- - combine with the labeld data --> learn conditional dist b.w. X and Y
- - entropy minimization; consistency regularization; generic regularization
